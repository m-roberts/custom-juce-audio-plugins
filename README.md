# Custom JUCE Audio Plugins

This repository contains audio applications (primarily audio plugins) using the JUCE framework without the need for Projucer.

This includes a GitHub Action for building - currently, this builds VST3, AU and Standalone for macOS.

Support for Windows and Linux are provided theoretically, and have not been reviewed or tested.

## TODO

* Add [Mac Packaging](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_app_plugin_packaging.html)
  * Automate with `packagesbuild` command
